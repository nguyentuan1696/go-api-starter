# Go API Starter

A modern, production-ready Go API backend built with clean architecture principles and modular design. This project serves as a comprehensive starter template for building scalable web APIs with authentication, file storage, and business logic modules.

## Todo

- [ ] Use [do](https://github.com/samber/do) to manage dependency injection more easily and keep the code cleaner
- [ ] Add an example using Kafka to publish and consume messages for processing workers
- [ ] Add [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) to expose gRPC services over HTTP/JSON
